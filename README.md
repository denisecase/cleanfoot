# Cleanfoot

This is a fork of Greenfoot 3.6.1 which was moved from Ant to Maven and contains fixes like:
 - removed [data collection](https://bluej.org/blackbox/#what_data)
 - a public `greenfoot.Font(java.awt.Font)` constructor to easily integrate custom fonts 
 - cleaned up code
 - up to date dependencies 
 - usable via Maven

## Usage

### Maven

To use this library, you need to use the GammelCloud repo:

```xml
<repositories>
    <repository>
        <id>jitpack.io</id>
        <url>https://jitpack.io</url>
    </repository>
</repositories>
```

And the following dependency:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.github.lfuelling</groupId>
    <artifactId>cleanfoot</artifactId>
    <version>3.6.1</version>
</dependency>
```

### Gradle

If you use Gradle, you can reference the repository like this:

```groovy
repositories {
        maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }
}
```

and the dependency itself like this:

```groovy
implementation 'com.github.lfuelling:cleanfoot:3.6.1'
```

### Code

After adding it, the library can be used like the regular Greenfoot project is used (ie. no package names have been changed). 
If you need more information regarding using Greenfoot with Maven/Gradle and its implications, please see [this blog post](https://lerks.blog/making-games-with-greenfoot-without-greenfoot/).
